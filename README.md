## Set some goals bro

Enter your best 5k to get catered work out times for the first half of training

After running an all out 10k later in the training enter that time to get catered times for the rest of training

And if you are on Strava give some kudos to those who are doing it with you!!!

## Running Locally

`yarn start`
